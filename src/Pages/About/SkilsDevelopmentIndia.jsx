          <div className="mt-2">
            <p>
              Skill development is a critical component in India’s drive to
              become a global economic powerhouse. In a country where the youth
              population forms a significant part of the demographic dividend,
              ensuring employability through proper training and skill
              enhancement has never been more important. However, India’s
              vocational training landscape, as revealed by the National Sample
              Survey Office (NSSO) 2011-12 (68th round), indicates a significant
              gap in formal skill development. Among individuals aged between 15
              and 59 years, only 2.2% reported having received formal vocational
              training, while 8.6% had undergone non-formal vocational training.
            </p>
            <p>
              This substantial gap underscores the importance of implementing an
              inclusive vocational education framework that can reach every
              corner of the country and provide quality training that aligns
              with market needs.
